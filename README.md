# MAD255-Firebase-And-Advanced-RecyclerView
## Overview:
MAD255 College project: an exercise to familaiarize myself with Firebase.

This app connects to Firebase and reads user profile information from Firebase and populates a RecyclerView with it. Users can then add additional user data to the Firebase database and delete data too.
Additionally I added swipe and drag capabilities to the RecyclerView also.
